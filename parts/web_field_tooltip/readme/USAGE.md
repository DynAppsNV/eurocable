To use this module, you need to:

- Go to Settings / Technical / Database Structure / Fields Tooltips and
  configure tooltips for a field for a model. You will then be able to
  see on the form view of the model you chose, next to the label of the
  field you selected, the tooltip appear.
- You can also go directly on the form view of a model on which you want
  to add a tooltip and use the Manage tooltips Action to add a new
  tooltip, or edit or delete existing tooltips for this model.
- For manager users, they can decide to display a helper to add a
  tooltip on a field as some fields are not displayed with a label.
