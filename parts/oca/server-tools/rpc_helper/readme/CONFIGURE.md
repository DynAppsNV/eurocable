Enable debug mode and go to "Technical -\> Database Structure -\>
Models".

Open the model that you like to configure and go to the tab "RPC
config".

There you see a text field which supports JSON configuration.

The configuration is the same you can pass via decorator. The only
difference is that you have to wrap values in a dictionary like
{"disable": \[...values...\]}.

To disable all calls:

    {
        "disable": ["all"],
    }

To disable only some methods:

    {
        "disable": ["create", "write", "another_method"],
    }

NOTE: on the resulting JSON will be automatically formatted on save for
better readability.
