Companyweb is the expert in company information in Belgium.

This app provides insights into the financial health of Belgian
companies, directly from the Odoo Customer view.

Enhance the Odoo partner with Companyweb data, with one click:

-  Name and address
-  Status
-  Health barometer
-  Credit limit
-  Bankruptcy risk warnings
-  Key financial information (turnover, gross margin, profit/loss…)
-  etc

Copy the address from Companyweb to your Odoo partner address.

With this valuable information you can personally evaluate each company
and know who you are doing business with.

Try for free and get your credentials here:

Installation
============

This module can be installed in the usual way. It depends on the OCA
``web_notify`` module.

Usage
=====

With this integration you get detailed information about a company based
on the VAT number of the company.

This module comes with 2 security groups.

-  View Companyweb Data : can see the Companyweb data tab in contacts
-  Download Companyweb Data : can actually enhance data

Once your user has the correct permissions, open a partner that has a
belgian VAT number and click on the Companyweb button.

|image1|

If you don't see the Companyweb button, refresh your browser page and
check that the current user is in the correct Companyweb group.

If your Companyweb credentials are not known in the system or have
changed, you will be shown a wizard to enter them.

|image2|

If everything runs smoothly you'll see a confirmation popup in the upper
right corner of your screen.

|image3|

You can now view the Companyweb information in the corresponding tab.

|image4|

You can also use the "Copy Address" button to update the partner address
with the one obtained from Companyweb.

This module has been originally developed by
`ACSONE <https://acsone.eu>`__ for Odoo version 8.

It was subsequently enhanced by Jacques-Etienne Baudoux (BCIM sprl). The
data model of that version has been preserved to facilitate porting.

In 2021, the module was redeveloped under the current form, to support
the new Companyweb SOAP api. This development has been funded by
`Companyweb <https://www.companyweb.be>`__.
