For the pivots, on the comparison tab you can see the same option to

the set filter.

**Note:** For "days," it functions as a range; for example, "Last 7
days" returns the period from 7 days ago up to today. However, for other

"Last 1 month" returns the period from the first day of the previous
month to the last day of the previous month.
