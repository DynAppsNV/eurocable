Usage
=====

To see this module working:

1. Navigate to any menu that supports date-based filters.
2. Open **Custom period** tab.
3. Add new date filter with the provided options.

|Custom Period Option|

For the pivots, on the comparison tab you can see the same option to
make the comparison with the provided filter, taking th reference from
the set filter.

**Note:** For "days," it functions as a range; for example, "Last 7
days" returns the period from 7 days ago up to today. However, for other
options, it provides the range for the selected period. For instance,
"Last 1 month" returns the period from the first day of the previous
month to the last day of the previous month.
