======================================
Server configuration environment files
======================================


Installation
============

Do not install this module as is. Make it available to Odoo and edit the various environment INI
files.

The name should always be `server_environment_files`.

Caveats
=======

Values set in the files aren't changeable within Odoo and will overwrite values set in data files.
